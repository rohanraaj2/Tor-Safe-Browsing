## ðŸ”§ Included Files

### 1. `verify_onion.py`
- Verifies .onion URLs by:
  - Checking valid v2/v3 onion address format
  - Checking if the onion URL is indexed by Ahmia search engine
  - Checking if the onion site is reachable via Tor SOCKS proxy
- **Requires:** Python 3, [requests[socks]](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) (`pip install requests[socks]`), Tor running locally (default: `127.0.0.1:9050`)

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 verify_onion.py
```

---

### 2. `check_tor_bridge.sh`
- Verifies whether your system is routing traffic through **Tor SOCKS5 proxy**.
- Compatible with **obfs4 bridges** or standard Tor routing.

**Usage:**
```bash
bash check_tor_bridge.sh
```

---

### 3. `torrc-bridge-tails`
- Minimal Tor configuration using **obfs4 bridge**.
- Ideal for Tails OS or CLI environments.
- Replace `[REPLACE_WITH_BRIDGE]` with your real bridge line from [https://bridges.torproject.org/](https://bridges.torproject.org/).

**Usage:**
```bash
tor -f ~/torrc-bridge-tails
```

---


### 4. `enable_onion_only.sh`
- Enforces onion-only mode by updating your system Tor configuration to reject all non-onion (clearnet) exits.
- Backs up your current `/etc/tor/torrc` before making changes.
- **Requires root.**

**Usage:**
```bash
sudo bash enable_onion_only.sh
```

---

### 5. `disable_onion_only.sh`
- Removes the onion-only restriction from your Tor configuration, restoring clearnet access via Tor.
- **Requires root.**

**Usage:**
```bash
sudo bash disable_onion_only.sh
```

---

### 6. `autostart-tor.sh`
- Simple helper to autostart Tor using the `torrc-bridge-tails` config.
- Add to autostart routines or run manually after boot.

**Usage:**
```bash
chmod +x autostart-tor.sh
./autostart-tor.sh
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Ensure `curl` and `obfs4proxy` are installed for full functionality.
- Works best on **Linux** and **Tails OS**.
- Requires internet access and obfs4 bridge from Tor Project.
- Only use these tools for legal and ethical purposes.
- The scripts do not store or log any addresses.
